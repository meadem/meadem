## Max's Code Shack

A chemist/engineer by trade, but I like to make small python programs. 
🏡 Just looking for a safe place to lie my code. 🏕️

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some simulation and fitting software for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
- Also on landing a position as an electrochemical engineer. I just wrote a <a href="income_comparison.py">little code</a> to calculate if a job offer is good by factoring in COL, taxes, and salary.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about mass transport. So complicated!
- 💬 Ask me about electrochemistry! 🔌🧪
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to make my own vinegars, kombuchas, and other ferments.
