## Max's Code Shack 🏚️

A chemist/engineer by trade, but I like to make small python programs. Some of my doomed attempts at web dev lie in repose here. 🪦

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some <a href="https://github.com/meadem/chemax">python tools for echem data analysis</a> that I started in my Master's program and am finally polishing and improving.
-   Recently was working on some <a href="https://github.com/meadem/chemax/blob/845de68d961cf8aa050cccf07b0110a5e4595211/Z_sim.py">simulation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/meadem/chemax/blob/845de68d961cf8aa050cccf07b0110a5e4595211/Z_fit.py">fitting</a> software for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra. It was an enjoying challenge, hoping to return to it soon and roll it into the class object I'm using for the rest of my echem code.
- 🕵️‍♂️ Also trying to find a position as an electrochemical engineer. 👨‍🔬 I just wrote a <a href="https://github.com/meadem/random">little code</a> to compare payment offers in different states, using COL and state income tax.
- 💬 Ask me about electrochemistry! 🔌🧪
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to make my own vinegars, kombuchas, and other ferments. 🦠
