## Max's Code Shack 🏚️

A chemist/engineer by trade. I like to make small python programs.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some <a href="https://github.com/meadem/chemax">python tools for echem data analysis</a> that I started in my Master's program and am finally polishing and improving, including some code for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) <a href="https://github.com/meadem/Z_sim">simulation</a>. (planning to merge these two currently separate projects soon)
- 🕵️‍♂️ Currently interviewing for electrochemical engineer positions. 👨‍🔬 I just wrote a <a href="https://github.com/meadem/random">little code</a> to compare payment offers in different states, using COL and state income tax. (💬 Ask me about electrochemistry! 🔌🧪)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to make my own vinegars, kombuchas, and other ferments. 🦠
