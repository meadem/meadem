## Max's Code Shack 🏚️

A chemist/engineer by trade, but I like to make small python programs. Some of my doomed attempts at web dev lie in repose here. 🪦

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some <a href="https://github.com/meadem/chemax/blob/845de68d961cf8aa050cccf07b0110a5e4595211/Z_sim.py">simulation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/meadem/chemax/blob/845de68d961cf8aa050cccf07b0110a5e4595211/Z_fit.py">fitting</a> software for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra. It's a little more challenging than similar things I've done in the past, since it uses the complex number plane (in addition to other things.
- 🕵️‍♂️ Also on landing a position as an electrochemical engineer. 👨‍🔬 I just wrote a <a href="https://github.com/meadem/random">little code</a> to compare payment offers in different states, using COL and state income tax.
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing my knowledge about mass transport. So complicated! 🤓 Got me begging for thermodynamics back...
- 💬 Ask me about electrochemistry! 🔌🧪
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to make my own vinegars, kombuchas, and other ferments. 🦠
