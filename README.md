## Max's Code Shack

Just looking for a safe place to lie my code.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some simulation and fitting software for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Also on landing a position as an electrochemical engineer. I just wrote a little code to calculate if a job offer is good by factoring in COL, taxes, and salary.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about mass transport. So complicated!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about electrochemistry! ðŸ”ŒðŸ§ª
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to make my own vinegars, kombuchas, and other ferments.
